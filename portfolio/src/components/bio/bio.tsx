      Originally a Human Geography major, my interest in computing science and
      software development sparked after taking my first programming course in
      Summer 2022.
      <br></br> <br></br>
      The process of problem-solving and creating programs proved to be
      incredibly fulfilling, fuelling my desire to transfer into the School of
      Computing Science and to further pursue such rewarding efforts.
      <br></br> <br></br>
      Since then, I've attended many hackathons and have worked towards a
      transfer into the joint major between computing science and geographic
      information science at SFU. <br></br> <br></br>
      This goal was finally achieved in Summer 2023. <br></br> <br></br>
      Currently, I am honing my skills in{" "}
      <strong>full-stack development</strong>, with interest in{" "}
      <strong>web GIS</strong>. I have also been refining my skills in
      <strong> data analytics</strong> and <strong>data science</strong>.
      <br></br> <br></br>
      In my down time, I enjoy playing video games (especially role-playing
      games), jamming on the guitar + bass + drums, and diving into topics such
      as urbanism, anthropology, and history. <br></br> <br></br>
