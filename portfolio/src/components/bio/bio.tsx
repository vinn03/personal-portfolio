        About Me
      </h1>
      <p className="font-inter text-lg text-navy-800 dark:text-blue-100">
        I'm currently studying both computing science and geographic information
        science (GIS) at Simon Fraser University (SFU).
        <br /><br />
        Originally as a Human Geography major, I started pursuing programming
        early-on, finding fulfillment in solving niche problems across different
        modalities.
        <br /><br />
        With proficiency in GIS-related front-end development and data science, I
        am eager to explore opportunities in the geospatial realm and am always
        open to new challenges and learning experiences across other realms.
        <br /><br />
        In my down time, I enjoy playing role-playing games (i.e. Final Fantasy)
        and first-person shooters (i.e. Battlefield), jamming on the guitar, bass,
        and drums, and deep diving into urbanism, anthropology, and history.
