      I'm currently studying both computing science and geographic information
      science (GIS) at Simon Fraser University (SFU).
      <br></br> <br></br>
      Originally as a Human Geography major, I started pursuing programming
      early-on, finding fulfillment in solving niche problems across different
      modalities.
      <br></br> <br></br>
      With proficiency in GIS-related front-end development and data science, I
      am eager to explore opportunities in the geospatial realm and am always
      open to new challenges and learning experiences across other realms.
      <br></br> <br></br>
      In my down time, I enjoy playing role-playing games (i.e. Final Fantasy)
      and first-person shooters (i.e. Battlefield), jamming on the guitar, bass,
      and drums, and deep diving into urbanism, anthropology, and history.{" "}
